# Simple-Greedy-Snake-in-Windows
a little cmd game

A simple command greedy snake game, I used doubly linked list to code this program and most of this program was conceive in water classes(水课...直译www). My coding ability is limited at present, and I coded this simple game to enhance my data structures learning. ^v^

The game's rule is very plain, press w/W to move snake up, s/S to down, a/A to turn left and d/D to turn right. Enter q/Q to quit game anytime and press space to stop. The game has three different difficulties. When the difficulty is easy, characters will be blue (medium is yellow and hard is lightly red), the food values are 1, 2, 4 respectively. When snake bites itself, the game will be over. When snake move to the maze's boundary, it will emerge on the other side. I remember when I was in high school, the snake game on my dumbphone was also this rule hhh.

the tail pointer seems to do nothings in this program, in fact when I first thinked about how to refresh the snake and food, I only wanted to refresh the snake's head and tail, but finally I chose to refresh the whole snake (yeah I admitted that I was lazy... There still has more ways to address.

Here are some pictures about this game.
